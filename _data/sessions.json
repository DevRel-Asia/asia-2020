However, given the times, more and more transitioning needs to be made from on-site to online activities. Given that it is imperative for developments of relations internally and externally, it is something that we have to continue facilitating regularly. One of the biggest concerns about such a transition is always in regards to the \"feel\" of the hackathon itself; that it does not bring the interconnectedness of the community if everyone is not face to face. This talk will outline how to facilitate that transition and how to make the most out of an online hackathon for building developer relations and the challenges that will need to be overcome in order to do so.\n\nThe talk will introduce developers to an acronym I use to plan online hackathons which focus on effective relations for developers, S.C.A.L.E: Scalability, creativity, adaptability, learn, and energy. These five attributes guide one to planning an effective online hackathon, and I will go over it in detail in my talk.

The key drivers behind the boom were the emergence of new technologies and APIs, the better performance offered at a non-forbidding cost, and the automation of otherwise complex or highly specialised tasks. As the barriers to entry were lowered, aspiring developers poured into the ecosystem, diluting what we knew until then to be the ‘typical developer’ profile. At the same time, and as the role of developers as tooling decision makers is being strengthened, the competition among developer relations and marketing practitioners to catch developers’ attention has intensified. \r\n\r\nWe’re here to help you put the growth and diversity of the developer ecosystem in prospect - as well as the effectiveness of the various developer marketing activities. Not based on opinions, but with hard data.\r\n\r\nBased on data from our Developer Economics surveys that receive more than 30,000 responses annually, we will show you how the developer population has grown, and how we expect it to evolve. We will focus on the regional growth, and how the developer population in Asia has grown as compared to the rest of the world. We will show you how this growth relates to the emergence of key technologies, and how it has shaped the role of developers as decision makers. \r\n\r\nWe will next discuss the need for effective segmentation of the now diverse developer universe in order to optimise your developer marketing efforts. Starting off from if and how top developer relations practitioners go about to segment their audience (based on the responses of 60+ practitioners), we will discuss strategies to help you identify the most prominent developer personas in your target addressable market.\r\n\r\nIn our Developer Program Leader surveys, we ask leading developer marketing practitioners in which activities they invest their time and budget. Crossing this data with the types of vendor support and resources that developers are interested in, we show you how effective each of the popular developer marketing activities is, and where we recommend you focus your efforts, with a special focus on Asian developers. Last but not least, we show you trends on how developer program leaders justify their developer programs, what they estimate the marginal lifetime gain of an on-boarded developer to be, and which KPIs they use to measure the performance of developer marketing as compared to developer relations activities.","description_your_language":"","category_english":"DevRel","category_your_language":"","show":"true","speaker":"true","language":"english","speaker_id":"christina","speaker_name":"Christina Voskoglou","timezone":"UTC+1","start":"08:50","end":"09:20","title":{"english":"Developer population evolution and how effective DevRel practices are - in numbers","japan":"Developer population evolution and how effective DevRel practices are - in numbers","korea":"Developer population evolution and how effective DevRel practices are - in numbers","singapore":"Developer population evolution and how effective DevRel practices are - in numbers","vietnam":"Developer population evolution and how effective DevRel practices are - in numbers","indonesia":"Developer population evolution and how effective DevRel practices are - in numbers"},"description":{"english":"The developer ecosystem has been expanding rapidly over the last few years.

We will also highlight why women not only need to support each other in tech industry but also to include male participants in the movement; how we implement SheCodes’s mission to move forwards without leaving anyone behind. \r\n By the end of the talk, audience should be able to answer the question: is it possible that we have it all, the equality in tech, or it is indeed a mission impossible."},"category":{"english":"DevRel","japan":"DevRel","korea":"DevRel","singapore":"DevRel","vietnam":"DevRel","indonesia":"DevRel"},"track":"Sea"},{"id":"s_6","utc":"Sat Dec 30 1899 04:05:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","time":"Sat Dec 30 1899 12:05:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","JST":"Sat Dec 30 1899 13:05:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","range":"Sat Dec 30 1899 01:00:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","mc":"N/A","title_english":"Lunch","title_your_language":"","description_english":"","description_your_language":"","category_english":"Other","category_your_language":"","show":"true","speaker":"","language":"","speaker_id":"","speaker_name":"#N/A","speaker2_id":"","speaker2_name":"","speaker3_id":"","speaker3_name":"","speaker4_id":"","speaker4_name":"","speaker5_id":"","speaker5_name":"","speaker6_id":"","speaker6_name":"","start":"04:05","end":"05:05","title":{"english":"Lunch","japan":"Lunch","korea":"Lunch","singapore":"Lunch","vietnam":"Lunch","indonesia":"Lunch"},"description":{"english":"","japan":"","korea":"","singapore":"","vietnam":"","indonesia":""},"category":{"english":"Other","japan":"Other","korea":"Other","singapore":"Other","vietnam":"Other","indonesia":"Other"},"track":"Sea"},{"id":"s_7","utc":"Sat Dec 30 1899 05:05:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","time":"Sat Dec 30 1899 13:05:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","JST":"Sat Dec 30 1899 14:05:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","range":"Sat Dec 30 1899 00:30:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","mc":"Nori","title_english":"How to DevRel when you don't speak the language?","title_your_language":"","description_english":"You've build a solid developer community and program in your base country and are ready to conquer a new market.

We understand the interests of developers and are familiar with the operational strategies of major vendors, **We want to share our insights on \"How to do a good developer ecosystem in China\" from the perspective of a neutral third party in the developer community and the current state of the developer community and developer ecosystem in China**.","china":"对于技术驱动型就企业来说，“保持技术持续领先” 一直是企业发展战略的重中之重。但技术型企业往往低调务实，如何对外传达技术领先的企业形象，塑造和传播技术品牌 成为了一个重要的课题。**技术品牌的构建不仅有利于增强客户或 C 端用户对企业的信任，对于技术人才的招聘也有很大帮助。**\r\n\r\n而以开发者为目标客户的公司（如云计算、芯片半导体、开发者工具等），技术品牌则显得更加重要，**将直接影响公司的主营业务发展和技术革新**。不少以开发者为目标客户的企业都在内部设立了 “**开发者关系**” 部门，以建立起和开发者更积极的关系。\r\n\r\n作为中国领先的开发者社区，SegmentFault 拥有超过 600 万注册开发者用户，每个月上千万开发者流量（独立访客）。在服务开发者用户的同时，我们也在帮助科技企业在中国进行技术品牌传播、运营开发者生态（如：微软、华为、BAT、Arm中国、AWS等）。我们了解开发者的兴趣所在，也熟悉各大厂商的开发者运营策略，**我们希望以中立的开发者社区第三方视角分享我们对于“如何在中国做好开发者生态”的分享，和中国开发者社区和开发者生态的客观现状**。"},"category":{"english":"Community","japan":"Community","korea":"Community","singapore":"Community","vietnam":"Community","indonesia":"Community","china":""},"track":"China"},{"id":"c_3","utc":"Sat Dec 30 1899 02:45:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","time":"Sat Dec 30 1899 10:45:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","range":"Sat Dec 30 1899 00:30:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","room":"a","MC":"Shiny","title_english":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","title_your_language":"","description_english":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","description_your_language":"","category_english":"Community","category_your_language":"","show":"true","speaker":"true","language":"chinese","speaker_id":"richard","speaker_name":"Richard Lin","speaker2_id":"","speaker2_name":"","speaker3_id":"","speaker3_name":"","speaker4_id":"","speaker4_name":"","speaker5_id":"","speaker5_name":"","speaker6_id":"","speaker6_name":"","start":"02:45","end":"03:15","title":{"english":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","japan":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","korea":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","singapore":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","vietnam":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","indonesia":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","china":""},"description":{"english":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","japan":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","korea":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","singapore":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","vietnam":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","indonesia":"Developer Communities and DevRel in China","china":""},"category":{"english":"Community","japan":"Community","korea":"Community","singapore":"Community","vietnam":"Community","indonesia":"Community","china":""},"track":"China"},{"id":"c_4","utc":"Sat Dec 30 1899 03:15:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","time":"Sat Dec 30 1899 11:15:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","range":"Sat Dec 30 1899 00:30:00 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)","room":"a","MC":"Shiny","title_english":"VS Code, up close and personal with developers","title_your_language":"VS Code，与开发者零距离","description_english":"Visual Studio Code is a modern, lightweight code editor that is free, open source, cross-platform, and powerful.
