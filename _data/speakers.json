I have built from scratch several data teams, leading them to produce sophisticated customer and developer research that answers the ‘why’ and not just the ‘what’. I have repeatedly worked alongside senior management teams and offered recommendations on targeted marketing strategies based on segmentation, proving - always based on data! - the effectiveness of such strategies.\r\nAs the Senior Director of Research, I am responsible for all SlashData’s research products and I head the analyst and product teams.",
