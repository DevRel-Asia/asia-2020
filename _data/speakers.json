He is also the founder of KLDP.org, Koreaâ€™s biggest and oldest Open Source community which started as his small personal homepage in 1996. For +8 years, he spent a minimum of 4 hours every day managing and building up the community as a hobby even when he got employed, got married and became a dad. During this period, he acted not only as an engineer doing all the hacks and coding but also as a self-taught advocate of Linux and Open Source doing all kinds of DevRel activities. He never imagined that would become his job in the future.",

I have a long track record of more than 20 years of research innovation, advocating data science techniques and leading the setup of algorithm-based decision making processes and systems (such as recommendation systems) in large organisations before they were widely known or acceptable and even before â€˜data science' was a term. I have built from scratch several data teams, leading them to produce sophisticated customer and developer research that answers the â€˜whyâ€™ and not just the â€˜whatâ€™. I have repeatedly worked alongside senior management teams and offered recommendations on targeted marketing strategies based on segmentation, proving - always based on data! - the effectiveness of such strategies.\r\nAs the Senior Director of Research, I am responsible for all SlashDataâ€™s research products and I head the analyst and product teams.",

I have a long track record of more than 20 years of research innovation, advocating data science techniques and leading the setup of algorithm-based decision making processes and systems (such as recommendation systems) in large organisations before they were widely known or acceptable and even before â€˜data science' was a term. I have built from scratch several data teams, leading them to produce sophisticated customer and developer research that answers the â€˜whyâ€™ and not just the â€˜whatâ€™. I have repeatedly worked alongside senior management teams and offered recommendations on targeted marketing strategies based on segmentation, proving - always based on data! - the effectiveness of such strategies.\r\nAs the Senior Director of Research, I am responsible for all SlashDataâ€™s research products and I head the analyst and product teams.",
