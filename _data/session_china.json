However, technology-driven enterprises tend to be low-key and pragmatic, so how to convey a technology-leading corporate image and build and spread a technology brand has become an important issue. **The construction of a technical brand is not only helpful in enhancing the trust of customers or C-users, but also in recruiting technical talents. **Technology Branding\n\nFor companies that target developers as customers (e.g., cloud computing, chip semiconductors, developer tools, etc.), the technology brand is even more important **will directly impact the company's primary business development and technological innovation**. Many companies targeting developers have created internal \"**Developer Relations**\" departments to build a more positive relationship with developers.\n\nAs China's leading developer community, SegmentFault has over 6 million registered developer users and tens of millions of monthly developer traffic (unique visitors). In addition to serving developer users, we also help technology companies to spread their technology brands and operate developer ecosystems in China (e.g. Microsoft, Huawei, BAT, Arm China, AWS, etc.). We understand the interests of developers and are familiar with the operational strategies of major vendors, **We want to share our insights on \"How to do a good developer ecosystem in China\" from the perspective of a neutral third party in the developer community and the current state of the developer community and developer ecosystem in China**.",

From this understanding comes awareness (speaking at conferences or writing up best practices), enablement (getting started guides and tutorials), and engagement (making community members feel welcome and included). From this singular goal, you can more easily see where you fit into the broader tapestry of your company's goals and objectives for the weeks, months, and years ahead. The end result? A stable Developer Relations team that can easily point to the value they're bringing to the community as well as the company.",

    "description_english": "The Open Source Initiative's definition of open source focuses exclusively on how open source software (OSS) is licensed. This narrow definition often colors how we think of our OSS programs, frequently leading us to view them as primarily cost-cutting measure for our company. But the spirit of open source goes far beyond just licensing: Open source is defined by its community-driven, collaborative mode of software development. So it should be no surprise that the best open source programs have a laser focus on building thriving communities.\n\nEthics is the study of how to get along with others. This makes it the perfect tool for understanding how to build thriving, successful communities. It sounds obvious, but it bears repeating: other people deserve to be treated as people, not as a means to an end that we can leverage for business purposes. But what does that mean? I present a value-based framework for community building that ensures we treat our community members (and potential community members) with _empathy_, _respect_, and _generosity_. In my talk, I'll walk through each of those concepts in detail, and offer concrete, actionable advice for using these three values as the core of your open source program.",
