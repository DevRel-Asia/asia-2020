But the spirit of open source goes far beyond just licensing: Open source is defined by its community-driven, collaborative mode of software development. So it should be no surprise that the best open source programs have a laser focus on building thriving communities.\n\nEthics is the study of how to get along with others. This makes it the perfect tool for understanding how to build thriving, successful communities. It sounds obvious, but it bears repeating: other people deserve to be treated as people, not as a means to an end that we can leverage for business purposes. But what does that mean? I present a value-based framework for community building that ensures we treat our community members (and potential community members) with _empathy_, _respect_, and _generosity_.
