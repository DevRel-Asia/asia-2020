Are we discriminating other genders in tech by building a community for women in tech? More broadly, are women-focused organizations in technology sector contributing to a new kind of inequality in the name of fostering diversity in tech? \r\nIn order to understand the rationale behind these questions, we interviewed people who asked us. We hope to share these insights with the audience and our story of being the pioneer to empower women in tech in Vietnam. We will also highlight why women not only need to support each other in tech industry but also to include male participants in the movement; how we implement SheCodes’s mission to move forwards without leaving anyone behind. \r\n By the end of the talk, audience should be able to answer the question: is it possible that we have it all, the equality in tech, or it is indeed a mission impossible.",

Unfortunately, you don't speak its language nor understand its culture. Now what? Do you replicate your developer programs in its entirety?

Asia is home to 60% of the world's population with over 2000 languages - it is not a monolithic region and should not be treated as such. Despite only being fluent in English and having lived in Singapore most of my life, I was able to build developer communities and design effective developer programs in the region and I want to teach you how. \n\nI will share practical tips, pros and cons, and how to navigate foreign markets. You will walk away with practical steps to get started on expanding your developer programs to different countries!",

    "description_english": "Mentorship has been found to be important for women in tech, as it allows women to have a safe community to grow professionally and personally, receive practical guidance from experienced peers, and learn how to navigate their career and in the traditionally male-dominated industry. The enthusiasm for such mentorship among the women in tech community in Singapore and beyond was largely reflected in the success of TechLadies’ first virtual mentorship program in 2020. Our program attracted multinational applications from five times the maximum capacity of participants, spanning numerous fields of tech -- data analysis, data science, software engineering, product management, and UI/UX Design.\n\nIn this talk, the TechLadies Mentorship program will share our tips and strategies in making our first virtual mentorship program a success. This includes our outreach and marketing strategies to recruit participants, strategies to match suitable pairs of mentors and mentees, our thought process in devising a structured and balanced program focusing on both imperative technical and non-technical skills, and how we design for flexibility to cater to uncertain circumstances in COVID-19 era.\n\nWe will also share success stories of participants and mentors who have benefited from the program, including some exciting projects that participants have managed to produce throughout the course of their mentorship. We believe that our learning points and experience could inspire the growth of more such initiatives, and engender a stronger, more supportive community among women in tech in Asia.",

    "description_english": "As a community and industry, DevRel is arguably much more matured in the US, given the rise of Silicon Valley and well known DevRel pioneers like Twilio and Stackoverflow in the early 2000s. On the other side of the world, in Asia, DevRel has grown rapidly in the past 5 years, with local communities taking notes from Silicon Valley and more foreign tech companies like Mozilla and Nexmo investing within the region and bringing DevRel practices with them. Also arguably, Asia is an emerging DevRel region with a huge potential for global dev thought leadership. \r\n\r\nSome outcomes of being different in community/industry age, are evident in how quickly communities are growing in the younger region, how stable community cultures are in mature regions and how professionalized DevRel is in the region. While time will always be a factor, how can Asia’s DevRel community/industry adapt learnings from the US to grow here?\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also some factors that are unique to Asia and will shape our DevRel to look different in terms of how community/industry health is defined. For example, our region is highly diverse, while the US is a relatively homogenous culture and that presents a different challenge in collaboration and networking. The question is how we can innovate solutions for DevRel here and share those with other regions with similar challenges e.g. Europe. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore ways to think about these considerations, and continue to grow DevRel here in Asia!",
