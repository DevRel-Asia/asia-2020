<span class="lang en">I am passionate about bridging the chasm of understanding between companies and their customers - whether consumers or developers - through data and research. My life’s mission is to try to make the world a slightly better place, even in an infinitesimal way, by advancing fact-based knowledge, promoting understanding and cooperation between communities. I have a long track record of more than 20 years of research innovation, advocating data science techniques and leading the setup of algorithm-based decision making processes and systems (such as recommendation systems) in large organisations before they were widely known or acceptable and even before ‘data science' was a term. I have built from scratch several data teams, leading them to produce sophisticated customer and developer research that answers the ‘why’ and not just the ‘what’. I have repeatedly worked alongside senior management teams and offered recommendations on targeted marketing strategies based on segmentation, proving - always based on data! - the effectiveness of such strategies.

<span class="lang en">The developer ecosystem has been expanding rapidly over the last few years. The key drivers behind the boom were the emergence of new technologies and APIs, the better performance offered at a non-forbidding cost, and the automation of otherwise complex or highly specialised tasks. As the barriers to entry were lowered, aspiring developers poured into the ecosystem, diluting what we knew until then to be the ‘typical developer’ profile. At the same time, and as the role of developers as tooling decision makers is being strengthened, the competition among developer relations and marketing practitioners to catch developers’ attention has intensified. 

We’re here to help you put the growth and diversity of the developer ecosystem in prospect - as well as the effectiveness of the various developer marketing activities. Not based on opinions, but with hard data.

Based on data from our Developer Economics surveys that receive more than 30,000 responses annually, we will show you how the developer population has grown, and how we expect it to evolve. We will focus on the regional growth, and how the developer population in Asia has grown as compared to the rest of the world. We will show you how this growth relates to the emergence of key technologies, and how it has shaped the role of developers as decision makers. 

We will next discuss the need for effective segmentation of the now diverse developer universe in order to optimise your developer marketing efforts. Starting off from if and how top developer relations practitioners go about to segment their audience (based on the responses of 60+ practitioners), we will discuss strategies to help you identify the most prominent developer personas in your target addressable market.

In our Developer Program Leader surveys, we ask leading developer marketing practitioners in which activities they invest their time and budget. Crossing this data with the types of vendor support and resources that developers are interested in, we show you how effective each of the popular developer marketing activities is, and where we recommend you focus your efforts, with a special focus on Asian developers. Last but not least, we show you trends on how developer program leaders justify their developer programs, what they estimate the marginal lifetime gain of an on-boarded developer to be, and which KPIs they use to measure the performance of developer marketing as compared to developer relations activities.</span>

We will next discuss the need for effective segmentation of the now diverse developer universe in order to optimise your developer marketing efforts. Starting off from if and how top developer relations practitioners go about to segment their audience (based on the responses of 60+ practitioners), we will discuss strategies to help you identify the most prominent developer personas in your target addressable market.

In our Developer Program Leader surveys, we ask leading developer marketing practitioners in which activities they invest their time and budget. Crossing this data with the types of vendor support and resources that developers are interested in, we show you how effective each of the popular developer marketing activities is, and where we recommend you focus your efforts, with a special focus on Asian developers. Last but not least, we show you trends on how developer program leaders justify their developer programs, what they estimate the marginal lifetime gain of an on-boarded developer to be, and which KPIs they use to measure the performance of developer marketing as compared to developer relations activities.</span>
