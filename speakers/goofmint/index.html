<span class="lang en">One of DevRel’s objectives is to raise awareness and gain mind share. To gain mindshare is equal to build a brand, and it calls branding.

In this session, we will introduce the basic concept of branding, how to assemble a story to be told, and how the organizational structure should be.

■ What is a brand?

Brand value consists of the following three values.

-Values of Product -Value of content -Value of relations

“Value of product” is the value of your service or product, “Value of content” is the value from recognition to purchase, “Value of relation” is the value from purchase to experience. Even if product offering value alone cannot differentiate, you can build and differentiate your brand based on content offering value and relation offering value. We can use the branding concept in DevRel. By strengthening content and relationships, we can build a strong brand for developers.

■ Brand effect

Brand building has the following two effects.

-Reduce new acquisition costs -Improvement of LTV for existing users

This is directly related to revenue.

■ How to start branding

Branding can be made company-wide or on a service-by-service basis.

Persona selection, needs and seeds extraction
