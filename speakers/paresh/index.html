<span class="lang en">As a community organiser, during the span of 10+ years, I've learnt a lot and explored lot of areas of developers community and it's effective management. I have also managed presence in the online developers community like Github and Stackoverflow, with that I am currently holding 100,000+ reputation over Stackoverflow.

In early days and stages of community management, I've seen many organisers face challenges like how to get speakers, how to build speakers database, how to build community, how to get more audience, social media presence and increasing the foot prints to the wider audience, venue management, partners managements, etc.

So during this talk, I would be sharing lot of these things, following are the links that I talked already about but I will change it with more relevant contents for this DevRel Asia event.
