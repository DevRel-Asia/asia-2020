My life’s mission is to try to make the world a slightly better place, even in an infinitesimal way, by advancing fact-based knowledge, promoting understanding and cooperation between communities. I have a long track record of more than 20 years of research innovation, advocating data science techniques and leading the setup of algorithm-based decision making processes and systems (such as recommendation systems) in large organisations before they were widely known or acceptable and even before ‘data science&#39; was a term. I have built from scratch several data teams, leading them to produce sophisticated customer and developer research that answers the ‘why’ and not just the ‘what’.
